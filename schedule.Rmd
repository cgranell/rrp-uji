This is the current course schedule. Things might change, so check regularly for updates.

## Week 1: Introduction to reproducibility

We cover learning outcomes [RRP01 to RRP04](index.html#learning-outcomes). We recognise landmark examples that have influenced the emphasis on reproducibility in the past decades and explain why reproducibility is important in current scientific endeavour. We highlight which components may be reproducible and take a PhD perspective for reproducibility.
