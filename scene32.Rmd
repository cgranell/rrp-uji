## Organisation & materials

**[Estimated time: 2 hours]**


[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and it's the next-generation of  [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

We rely on the excellent [rstudio::conf 2022 Workshop - Getting Started with Quarto](https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/get-started-quarto/) by Tom Mock, to learn the wide range of features that Quarto offers to produce elegantly formatted document adn content.
