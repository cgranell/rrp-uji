      "contents": "\r\n\r\nTo ensure a welcoming environment for all, we require everyone participating in the course to conform to the Code of Conduct given below. This code applies to all spaces related to the course including, but not limited to, classroom, ‘aula virtual’, emails, shared documents, and code repositories. We strongly recommend that anyone running workshops or classes of any kind choose and publish a similar code so that everyone will know what is expected of them and what to do when those expectations are not met.\r\n\r\nYou can report Code of Conduct violations in person to Carlos Granell.\r\nWe are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. However, we recognize that some groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, color, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.\r\nHarassment is any form of behavior intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behavior in our community, regardless of intent.\r\nProhibited harassing behavior includes but is not limited to:\r\nwritten or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above;\r\ncausing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation;\r\nthe display of sexual or violent images;\r\nunwelcome sexual attention;\r\nnon-consensual or unwelcome physical contact;\r\nsustained disruption of talks, events or communications;\r\nincitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm;\r\ncontinuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop; and\r\npublication of private communication without consent.\r\nBehavior not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on or offline, and the same standards apply to both.\r\nEnforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.\r\nThank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.\r\n[This code of conduct is a simplification of the CoC for Reproducible Research workshos at AGILE, which is based on a CoC for Teaching Tech Together by Greg Wilson, which in turn is based on that used by PyCon, which in turn is forked from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the Geek Feminism Wiki.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

While the course is running, some material might not be visible and will be unlocked as the course proceeds. At any other time, this website is continuously online, with small updates happening on an ongoing basis and larger updates every time the course is offered again.\r\nCourse identification\r\nCode/Name: MI006.TMP - Reproducible Research Practices\r\nDuration: 6 hours (up to 20 hours including attendance and self-directed work)\r\nDates: 18 and 25 April, 2 May 2023, from 10 to 12\r\nTeaching language: English (Note: in Spanish even years, in English odd years)\r\nTeaching staff:\r\nCarlos Granell  Associate Professor in Computer Science  Office UB1520DD, Espaitec2, 5th floor  Universitat Jaume I, Spain\r\nSergi Trilles  PostDoc - JdC  Office UB-1518DD, Espaitec2, 5th floor  Universitat Jaume I, Spain\r\nDetail course description in Spanish and English\r\nPurpose\r\nThis course emphasises the principles and strategies of open science and reproducible research practices and gives you practice in their application to present scientific and technical material in an informative and clear manner.\r\nWe are not talking about “learning to programme” as a course objective or “knowing how to programme” as a previous requirement. Of course, an open mindset is presupposed so that the course participants can incorporate new practices/recommendations into their research process.\r\nLearning outcomes\r\nBriefly, the course’s learning outcomes are to help you:\r\n[RRP01] Recognise the importance of (computational) reproducible research as a fundamental pillar of open science.\r\n[RRP02] Compare and contrast the RE-* terms (reproduce, replicate, recreate, etc) within the context of each participant’s own discipline.\r\n[RRP03] Describe and distinguish the reproducibility criteria.\r\n[RRP04] Assess participants’ own work according to the reproducibility criteria.\r\n[RRP05] Organise a research project to facilitate reproducibility, openness and reuse.\r\n[RRP06] Contrast the main families of licences for software and data.\r\n[RRP07] Understand the value of combining questions, source code and outcomes.\r\n[RRP08] Apply notebooks to the documentation of computational analyses.\r\n[RRP09] Design and create notebooks for producing academic articles, technical reports or presentations.\r\n[RRP09] Create a Reproduction Plan and reflect on the next steps to achieve it.\r\nGetting started\r\nThis web site is the main theatre entrance to the play of reproducible research practices, and participants, you all, are the main performers! To start, click on casting to get general information about the course, such as the code of conduct, roles in the play (or learning persona) and the acts (or course schedule). Tonight’s play, with acts and scenes, is ready to be performed on the stage. If you like it, feel free to go backstage to inspect additional documents and materials to go deeper into this topic.

      "contents": "\r\n\r\nContents\r\nCeline\r\nVíctor\r\nJuan\r\nAna\r\n\r\nLike you, a Learner Persona (Wilson 2019)) consists of:\r\na general background,\r\nwhat you already know,\r\nwhat you want to know, and\r\nother special needs you may have.\r\nIf you are working on your doctoral thesis, do you identify better with Celine or with Víctor? If you are part of the teaching staff, do your learning needs fit better with those of Juan or with those of Ana?\r\nCeline\r\nCeline has a degree in psychology from England and has just enrolled in the UJI doctoral school. Her doctoral thesis deals with the application of new technologies to improve behavioral therapies for patients diagnosed with gambling addiction.\r\nCeline plans to carry out several experiments with patients during her doctoral period. She knows some tools for data analysis (such as SPSS) from her bachelor’s degree, but she has never taken a formal programming course, although she has thought about it often. She sometimes thinks that she suffers from the impostor syndrome as soon as she faces with programming languages or advanced data analytical tools.\r\nCeline would like to systematize the data analysis of the experiments that she will be conducting in her doctoral project. Yet, above all, she wants to prove to herself that she can learn computational competences. The terms reproducibility and replicability sound familiar to her and she thinks that they can be useful to speed up the tedious work of her experiments, but she does not know where to start.\r\nVíctor\r\nVíctor studied a chemistry degree at UJI and is in the final phase of his PhD thesis on computational chemistry, which he hopes to defend once he completes a planned research stay in France.\r\nVíctor learned R early in his thesis period and it is still the programming language in his research. Like in many other tools, he was self-taught in the use of Github and uses it to version his own software and to collaborate with other colleagues. He has published some relevant articles in which the developed software has been a main contribution.\r\nVíctor wants to improve his skills and expand his knowledge about reproducibible workflows. The best academic journals in his field now require that every submission come with code and data, and he knows that an article published in those high-profile journals can open the door to a postdoc.\r\nJuan\r\nJuan is a professor of Economics at the UJI. He has four six-year research periods and a good record of scientific publications. He is responsible for a quantitative economics course which in turn is the focus of his research.\r\nJuan is surprised by the current hype about the reproducibility crisis that he reads about in Science and Nature editorials. He considers that crisis an exaggeration, like so many other buzzwords that he has witnessed in his long academic career. He has never needed reproducibility to have a successful academic career.\r\nDespite this, Juan wants to make sure that his beliefs about reproducibility and reproducible practices are well founded.\r\nAna\r\nAna is a professor of Computer Science at the UJI. She hardly never investigates, but she is very active and is concerned with improving her teaching practices. She is responsible for an introductory programming course for large groups of freshmen.\r\nAna is up to date with teaching innovations and everything related to educational technology. For a decade, she has been applying the most recent learning methodologies and innovative techniques in her classes with considerable success, according to what her students say in surveys.\r\nAna wants to know if reproducibility and teaching combine in some way, since reproducibility and research always go hand in hand in everything she has read. She is wodering how to bring reproduciblity aspects into her practical sessions, such as in peer asessment and peer instructions, and even for the creation of teaching materials. She is interested in guides and practical examples to get inspired to improving her teaching materials and practical classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilson, Greg. 2019.
