# “science is in crisis” narrative is wrong 

### `r Cite(my_refs, "fanelli2018")`: _`r my_refs["fanelli2018"]$title`_

> The new “science is in crisis” narrative is not only empirically unsupported, but also quite obviously counterproductive. Instead of inspiring younger generations to do more and better science, it might foster in them cynicism and indifference. Instead of inviting greater respect for and investment in research, it risks discrediting the value of evidence and feeding antiscientific agendas.

> Therefore, contemporary science could be more accurately portrayed as facing “new opportunities and challenges” or even a “revolution”. __Efforts to promote transparency and reproducibility would find complete justification in such a narrative of transformation and empowerment__, a narrative that is not only more compelling and inspiring than that of a crisis, but also better supported by evidence.

.large[A reproducible paper ensures a reviewer or reader can recreate the computational workflow of a study or experiment, including the prerequisite knowledge and the computational environment. The former implies the scientific argument to be understandable and sound. The latter requires a detailed description of used software and data, and both being openly available.]

# Reproducibility spectrum `r Cite(my_refs, "peng2011")`

# Summary

### Reproducibility involves the .coldinline[ORIGINAL] data and code:
1. checking the published manuscript, 
1. looking for published data and code, then 
1. comparing the results of that data and code to the published results. 
1. if they are the same, the study is reproducible; otherwise, it is not.


### Replicability involves .fatinline[NEW] data collection to test for consistency with previous results of a smiliar study.

- Replication is to advance theory by confronting existing understanding with new evidence.`r Cite(my_refs, "nosek2020")` 
- Replication is accumulated  evidence 
- Even when paper is computationally reproducible, it may fail to be replicated
