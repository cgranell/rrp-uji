.large[Rubén Herzog, Universidad de Valparaíso in Chile, published a 2020 [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74060-6) in Scientific Reports]

--

.large[Paul Lodder, a grad student at the University of Amsterdam, wanted to expand on the model used by Rubén]

--

.large[Paul reproduced the paper's analysis results before looking into expanding...and got .gray.bg-blue[different results]]


> I (Paul) shared my findings with Rubén by writing up a .gray.bg-blue[literate programming report], which allowed me to present my findings in a reproducible manner by including the code that leads to any of the results discussed.

> Because I (Paul) was able to run his code and mine on the same simulated data, it was very clear that the typo caused the results from the paper
