### Raw data

.huge[Remember [Newton's letter to Flamsteed](https://cgranell.github.io/rrp-uji/slides/slides11_01.html#newton)]

-   .large[Store raw data permanently (in the `data-raw` folder)]

# .blue.bg-white[\#5]

# Use open data formats

---

### Open formats

.huge[Use open, text-based formats whenever possible]

.huge[Alternatively, provide data in an open format besides proprietary format] 

-   .large[.xls + .csv]

### README file(s)

  -   If your project is on GitHub, README files will be automatically visualised if written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) (Act III)


-   .large[Include (if required) __README files__ in each subfolder to describe metadata/complex content]

### A .gray.bg-blue[license] is a .gray.bg-blue[contract] between the authors and the users

.large[Without a license, **copyright** is automatically attached to your work] 

.large[If you need it, add a **LICENSE filename** to apply a license to your work]

### Data licenses

.huge[Always add a [license](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-data.html) to the data you plan to make public]
