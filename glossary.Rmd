To clarify the meaning of some key terms and concepts used throughout this course, such as replication, replicability, open science, and open data, we briefly define them below.

### Open Access

Open access content is accessible to all with no barriers: no authentication requirements, no resources under an embargo, no paid access, etc. Content may concern scientific publications, data, code, documentation, and any other research artefact relevant to produce or interpret correctly the results of the research. 

### Open Science

For [@munafo2017], "Open science refers to the process of making the content and process of producing evidence and claims transparent and accessible to others." 

### Reproducibility

The capacity of another researcher or group of researcher to obtain the same results using the same methods and data (and most likely using the same or similar computational environment) from the original study. This highlights the importance of the methods used to produce such results.
