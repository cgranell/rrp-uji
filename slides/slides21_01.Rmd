### Raw data

.huge[Remember [Newton's letter to Flamsteed](https://cgranell.github.io/rrp-uji/slides/slides11_01.html#newton)]

-   .large[Store raw data permanently (in the `data-raw` folder)]

### README file(s) 


-   .large[Include (at least) a __README file__ in the root folder to describe the project, provide basic orientation to use your code, data, etc. ]

  -   Suggestions for writing a good [README](https://www.makeareadme.com/) and [GitHub's README](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)

  -   If your project is on GitHub, README files will be automatically visualised if written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)


-   .large[Include (if required) __README files__ in each subfolder to describe metadata/complex content]

-   .large[Keep track of ideas, discussions and decisions about the project (in the `notes` folder)]

-   .large[Use simple formatting language/tool for writing plain text files that can be version controlled]

### A .gray.bg-blue[license] is a .gray.bg-blue[contract] between the authors and the users

.large[Without a license, **copyright** is automatically attached to your work] 

.large[If you need it, add a **LICENSE filename** to apply a license to your work]

.large[`r cite("jolly2012")`: _`r title("jolly2012")`_]

---
class: left
### Data licenses

.huge[Always add a [license](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-data.html) to the data you plan to make public]
