  -   Suggestions for a good [README](https://www.makeareadme.com/)] and [GitHub's READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)

  -   If your project is on GitHub, README files will be automatically visualised if written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) (Act III)


-   .large[Include (if required) __README files__ in each subfolder to describe metadata/complex content]

-   .large[Keep track of ideas, discussions and decisions about the project (in the `notes` folder)]
