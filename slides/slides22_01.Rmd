##  What is the scientific method? (for Popper)

.huge[Science progresses through *conjectures and refutations*]

--

-   .large[Scientists are confronted with some question, and offer a possible answer] 

--

-   .large[The  answer is a *conjecture* initially (is it right or wrong?)]

--

-   .large[Scientists do their best to *refute* this conjecture, or prove it wrong]

--

-   .large[Typically it is refuted, rejected, and replaced by a better one]

--

-   .large[This too will then be tested, and eventually replaced by an even better one]

--

-   .large[If scientists have not been able to refute a theory over a long period of time, despite their best efforts, then the theory has been *corroborated*]
