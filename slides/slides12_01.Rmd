# Objectives of scientific research

--

.huge[Discover laws, axioms, rules, etc. and describe under which conditions they apply]

--

.huge[Conduct case studies to prove a general principle or theory]

--

.huge[Transfer/publish results to prove validity, veracity, trust in findings]

--

> One of the pathways by which scientists confirm the validity of a new
finding or discovery is by repeating the research that produced it.


> Observed inconsistency may be an important precursor to new discovery while 
others fear it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science


---

# Reproducibility involves the .gray.bg-blue[ORIGINAL] data and code

-   .large[check the published manuscript,]

-   .large[look for published data and code, then]

-   .large[compare the results of that data and code to the published results]

-   .large[if they are the same, the study is reproducible; otherwise, it is not]

---

# Replicability involves .gray.bg-blue[NEW] data collection and/or methods

-   .large[Replication is to test for consistency with previous results of a similar study]

-   .large[Replication is to advance theory by confronting existing understanding with new evidence] `r cite("nosek2020")` 

-   .large[Replication is accumulated evidence] (way to plan a PhD project?)

-   .large[Even when a paper is computationally reproducible, it *may fail* to be replicated]
